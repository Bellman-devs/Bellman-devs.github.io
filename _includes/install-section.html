  ### Getting help

  **Bugs, feature requests, pain points, annoying design quirks, etc:**
  Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Bellman-devs/bellman/issues/) to flag up bugs/issues/pain points, suggest new features, and discuss anything else related to the use of Bellman that in some sense involves changing the Bellman code itself. We positively welcome comments or concerns about usability, and suggestions for changes at any level of design. We aim to respond to issues promptly, but if you believe we may have forgotten about an issue, please feel free to add another comment to remind us.

  **"How-to-use" questions:**
  Please use [Stack Overflow (Bellman tag)](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/Bellman) to ask questions that relate to "how to use Bellman", i.e. questions of understanding rather than issues that require changing Bellman code. (If you are unsure where to ask, you are always welcome to open a GitHub issue; we may then ask you to move your question to Stack Overflow.)
